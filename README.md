# Sleep-Patterns-Analysis
This is my final project for DS2001 (Health Practicum) that aims to convey the trends in sleep patterns for different age groups across a decade. It could also aims to determine whether recent technology has impacted the sleep quality of younger generations. Results indicate that the different age groups are equally prone to the disruptions toward their circadian rhythms. Observing the patterns through correlational analysis, adolescents and adults alike can benefit from learning the effects of electronic devices and screens prior to bed and better enhance sleep conditions for the long term.
